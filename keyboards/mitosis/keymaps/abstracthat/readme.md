Qwerty layout with Colemak Curl (ortholinear, with M on the home row and K below it) and Tarmak transition layers. Layers are designed to maximize the use of thumbs and minimize the use of pinkies.

There are NO Mod/tap keys (hold for mod, tap for key) as I find those to be impossible to use on alphas. The downside is that you sometimes have a difficult key combo to press with the left thumb. To accommodate those I've added a modifier hold key which toggles and holds any modifier pressed after.

The default layout is Qwerty with some punctuation changes. With the goal of switching to Colemak over time, you can enable the four steps of Tarmak as separate layer toggles. The currently selected layout is stored as the default persistent layer and will remain through power cycles.

The pink Adjust layer is accessed by holding down Raise and Lower layers simultaneously.
